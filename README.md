Student Management System

Description:

This repository contains a simple command-line-based Student Management System implemented in C++. The system allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records, including adding new students, deleting existing ones, editing student information, searching for students by ID, and displaying all student records. It also provides functionality to save student records to a file and load them from a file.

Features:

Login System: Users are required to log in with a username and password before accessing the system. The default username and password are provided as "admin" and "password" respectively.
CRUD Operations: Users can add, delete, edit, search, and display student records through intuitive command-line prompts.
Data Persistence: Student records are stored in a text file (students.txt) and are loaded into memory upon system startup. Changes made to student records are saved back to the file.

Dependencies:

This project has no external dependencies other than a standard C++ compiler.
